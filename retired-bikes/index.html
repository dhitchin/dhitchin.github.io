                    <h2>About Retired Bikes</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am Jason Manning and I am starting Retired Bikes with the goal of repairing and refurbishing discarded and "broken" bikes for children and adults who are unable to get one themselves.</p>
                    <p>I have noticed in my neighborhood that people are constantly throwing out old "broken" bikes.  Most of these bikes are in great condition; they just need a couple new tubes, new brake pads, a new seat, etc.  My vision is that when I see these bikes being thrown in the trash, I can take these bikes, spend a little time and elbow grease and get these things up and ready for their new owner.  At this point I will take these to local Fire Houses, City buildings, and other nonprofits that can find proper homes for these now refurbished bikes.</p>

                    <h2>What We Need</h2>
                    <p>Right now, I am asking for help to get this thing to be legitimate.</p>
                    <p>I need to get some legal and financial things figured out and drawn up to get my nonprofit status. From there, I will have some basic things I will need to keep in stock in my garage. For the most part, I have the tools needed to work on a bike. Maybe a bike stand down the line, but right now, I am looking to fund legal fees and some stock of standard and common parts to fix these bikes.</p>
                    <p>These funds are important. I have a few local bike shops that want to help out but can’t donate until I have been awarded nonprofit status.</p>

                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>I am Jason Manning, and I am a Father, Husband, Son, Little League Coach, and Neighbor.  I have had this put on my heart since the day my son first stayed up without training wheels.</p>
                    <p>He started to peddle and I gave him a little push and off he went! I saw how he could ride and it was as if a whole new world just opened up for him. He could now move around (the parking lot at the time) at any speed he wanted and it was most definitely faster than running. When you are 3 years old, speed matters! His imagination was running wild. He was racing others. He was on a space speeder dodging aliens and asteroids. He was whatever he wanted to be at that moment! He had a glow about him for the rest of the night. I saw this again with my daughter just last summer. Her Minnie Mouse tassels sparkling in the air as she was trying her hardest to keep up with her older brother.</p>
                    <p>Not everyone has this opportunity. My son was blessed to be able to get a bike for his birthday. There are kids that are not as lucky as my son though. This isn’t always their fault.</p>
                    <p>This is my heart connecting with my son and daughter that night in the parking lot and hoping that, together, we can provide opportunities for those memories and feelings and connections with parents, children grandchildren and all who can pedal.</p>

                    <p>If you have a bike that is no longer needed, please feel free to contact me about donating it.  If it is fully functional, we will find it a home.  If it is repairable, we will fix it up and find it a home.  If it is beyond repair, we will take the parts that are usable and use them, and any unusable parts will be recycled and the funds used for future repairs.</p>
